Welcome!

Thanks for taking our coding challenge!  We'd like for you to implement a basic event management system using the provided VividSeats.eventService API, and the wireframes at: [http://app.mockflow.com/view/bd9d29995b2e320c0ac0d1f5edb15a39](http://app.mockflow.com/view/bd9d29995b2e320c0ac0d1f5edb15a39).

The basic features should include:
* Display events (event name, date, venue name, city, state) in list/tabular format
* Edit events
* Add events
* Remove Events

The following stretch goal is optional:
* Display groupings of events (by city, or by date)

Please refer to the wireframes for a rough idea of what we're looking for.  Feel free to take creative liberties, however please ensure you cover the core features requested. You may use any open source javascript frameworks or libraries you like. Please make sure you commit your work to Github.

You're welcome to take as much time as you like. We expect it to take 1-3 hours, but this is not a strict time limit. Better to build half a product than a bad product.

When starting we would ask that you make an 'inital commit' to serve as a reference timestamp. We also ask that you periodically add commits along the way to serve as a reference to how much was completed at specific times.

Thanks, and enjoy!
